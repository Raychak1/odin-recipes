        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Old-fashioned gingerbread is everyone's holiday favorite. This recipe is so easy to make and probably very similar to the one your great-grandmother used to make.</p>
        <p>This moist and lightly spiced gingerbread cake can be served with a dusting of powdered sugar, a dollop of whipped cream, or a scoop of vanilla ice cream. If you prefer a gingerbread with more spice, just double or triple the cinnamon, ginger, and cloves.</p>
